# Setup

You need a cluster to run `flux` operations. A simple and lightweight cluster management option can be [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/)

## kind

Install kind

```sh
brew install kind
```

Create a new cluster called `moonshot`

```sh
kind create cluster --name moonshot
```

This will create a new cluster using latest Kind Node Image.
When you list containers using `docker container ls`, you will see the Kind Control Plane.

```sh
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                  COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                       NAMES
13ebb8a488b4   kindest/node:v1.25.3   "/usr/local/bin/entrâ€¦"   2 minutes ago   Up 2 minutes   127.0.0.1:65063->6443/tcp   moonshot-control-plane
```

By default, the cluster access configuration is stored in `${HOME}/.kube/config` if `$KUBECONFIG` environment variable is not set.
You can use the new directly from terminal as Kind must have already set your `kubectl` context. You can check current context with:

```sh
kubectl cluster-info
cat ~/.kube/config
```

To see all the clusters you have created, you can use the `get clusters` command.

## Github

You need a repository to push configurations of your cluster so that Flux can pull and apply.
You can create a personal access token to use in place of a password with the command line or with the API.
For that, Flux needs `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `GITHUB_USER` available in the environment.

There are multiple ways to create a `GITHUB_TOKEN`. A simpler way could be using [Github Settings Page](https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta).
More details can be found on this page:
<https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token>.

After creating your token, add it to your environment

```sh
export GITHUB_TOKEN=<your-token>
export GITHUB_USER=<your-username>
```
